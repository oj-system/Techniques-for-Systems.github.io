# Techniques for Conscious Modulation of Dissociative States

## 8 Core Techniques

| Technique | What You Do | Why It Works |
|-----------|------------|-------------|
| **The Container** | Visualize a secure object (vault, box, safe) to temporarily store overwhelming memories or feelings until you're ready to process them in therapy. | **Containment & Affect Regulation** – Prevents emotional flooding. |
| **Safe Place** | Create a detailed mental environment where your system (or specific parts) feels completely calm and protected. Use all five senses: what you see, hear, feel, smell, taste. | **Self-Soothing & Stabilization** – Activates your parasympathetic (calming) nervous system. |
| **Internal Meeting Room** | Visualize a neutral table or room where different parts can sit together to discuss decisions without one part taking over the body. | **Co-consciousness & Negotiation** – Reduces sudden, chaotic switching. |
| **Internal Bulletin Board** | Use a mental or physical whiteboard/journal for parts to leave asynchronous messages, reminders, or signals for each other. | **Internal Communication** – Bridges amnesia between parts. |
| **Dimmer Switch** | Visualize a dial or slider to "turn down" the intensity of an emotion or a part's presence without shutting it off completely. | **Titration (Volume Control)** – Lets you stay functional while honoring a part's need to be present. |
| **Positive Anchoring** | Associate specific sensory cues (a playlist, essential oil scent, texture) with a functional part to *invite* it to come forward when needed. | **Voluntary Switching** – Replaces involuntary, traumatic switches with conscious choice. |
| **5-4-3-2-1 Grounding** | Name 5 things you **see**, 4 things you **feel**, 3 things you **hear**, 2 things you **smell**, 1 thing you **taste**. Do this immediately after a switch or flashback. | **Orientation to Present Time** – "Locks" your body into NOW, not the past. |
| **Dual Awareness** | Practice keeping one foot in the "here and now" while acknowledging the "there and then" of a flashback or memory without being consumed by it. | **Mentalization** – Allows you to observe trauma without being re-traumatized. |

## When to Use Each Skill

| Skill | Use it when… | Goal in the moment | Then move to… |
|---|---|---|---|
| Container | You're getting flooded by memories/feelings, intrusive images, urges, or "too much at once." | Park material safely so life can continue. | 5-4-3-2-1 → Safe Place → later, discuss contents in therapy. |
| Safe Place | You feel unsafe inside, emotionally raw, hypervigilant, or "close to switching." | Downshift arousal and restore safety. | Grounding → Dual Awareness (if flashback-y) → Internal Meeting Room (if conflict inside). |
| Internal Meeting Room | Multiple parts want different things; decisions feel chaotic; switching risk is high. | Cooperation, negotiation, shared plan. | Bulletin Board (to keep agreements) → Positive Anchoring (to recruit the right part for tasks). |
| Internal Bulletin Board | You lose time, forget plans, or can't "hear" each other clearly. | Communication without needing a live internal meeting. | Meeting Room (once communication improves) → Anchoring (to implement plans). |
| Dimmer Switch | A part/emotion is "too loud," but shutting it down makes things worse. | Titration: reduce intensity while staying connected. | Grounding → Dual Awareness → Meeting Room (to validate needs and renegotiate). |
| Positive Anchoring | You need a specific capability (work, study, driving, social) and want fewer involuntary switches. | Invite a functional state forward deliberately. | Grounding (to stabilize after shift) → Bulletin Board (to log what happened). |
| 5-4-3-2-1 Grounding | You're spacing out, derealizing, getting tunnel vision, or coming out of a switch/episode. | Re-orient to "now" using senses. | Safe Place (if still unsafe) → Dimmer Switch (if emotion remains high). |
| Dual Awareness | You're partly in a flashback: one foot in the past, one in the present. | Stay present while acknowledging trauma material safely. | Container (if it escalates) → Safe Place (if you need calm) → later, process with clinician. |

## Navigation Tree: What to Work On

```
Start
├─ Is there immediate danger / self-harm risk?
│  └─ Seek urgent support; use 5-4-3-2-1 while getting help.
└─ What's the main problem right now?
   ├─ "I'm flooding / overwhelmed"
   │  ├─ Container
   │  └─ 5-4-3-2-1 → Safe Place → later: therapy work on what was contained
   ├─ "I'm not present / spacing out"
   │  └─ 5-4-3-2-1 → Safe Place → Dimmer Switch (if emotion stays high)
   ├─ "Flashback-y but functional"
   │  └─ Dual Awareness → (if too intense) Container → Safe Place
   ├─ "Internal conflict / switching pressure"
   │  └─ Internal Meeting Room → Bulletin Board (agreements) → Positive Anchoring (do the plan)
   ├─ "No communication / time loss"
   │  └─ Bulletin Board → Meeting Room (once stable enough)
   └─ "One part/emotion is overpowering"
      └─ Dimmer Switch → Grounding → Meeting Room (validate + renegotiate)
```

## What to Work On Next

**If stabilization is weak** (frequent flooding, dissociation spikes): prioritize **Grounding + Safe Place + Container** first, then add Dual Awareness.

**If daily functioning is the bottleneck** (work/study/appointments): add **Positive Anchoring** plus a **Bulletin Board** so changes don't create more amnesia.

**If the system is "politically unstable"** (lots of internal conflict): prioritize **Meeting Room → Bulletin Board → Dimmer Switch** to reduce power-struggles before trying deliberate switching.

####  Specific Digital and Physical Tools for Systems:

Many modern systems use digital versions of this technique to allow parts with different “access levels” to leave notes:

	•	Discord: Create a private server for yourself with channels labeled by category (e.g.,  #shopping-list ,  #therapy-notes ,  #general-announcements ).
	•	Notion: Use a “Dashboard” layout to create visual tiles for each section of your bulletin board.
	•	Digital Logs of active parts - Octocon, and SimplyPlural.
	•	Shared Journal: A simple physical notebook placed in a “central location” (e.g. kitchen counter) where anyone fronting can see it.
	
####  Suggested “Board” Categories
	•	Housekeeping: Tasks that need doing (e.g., “fed the cat,” “need milk”).
	•	Safety: Safe places to go or emergency contacts.
	•	Vent / Requests: A place for parts to express feelings without taking over.
	•	Positive Wins: A place to celebrate something a part did well today.
	
Key Skill Tip: If you have younger parts who cannot read or write, encourage them to “post” pictures, drawings, or colors on the internal board to signal their feelings .

## Getting Started

1. **Start with one technique.** Choose the one that resonates most (usually Safe Place or Container first).
2. **Use the videos.** Watch them multiple times. Pause and practice along with the narration.
3. **Practice when calm.** Don't wait until crisis. Build the skill in your nervous system when you're regulated.
4. **Get a therapist if possible.** These techniques are *far* more effective with clinical guidance, especially for DID. It's very helpful to practice these skills with a therapist e.g. getting comfortable switching in the presence of others by utilising a safe person in a safe environment first.
5. **Be patient.** Your dissociation is a survival mechanism that kept you alive. It won't disappear overnight, but it *can* be negotiated.

---

## Safety Notes

These skills are most effective when practiced while relatively calm (not only during crises), which is why skills manuals for trauma-related dissociation emphasize structured, repeated practice.

If any technique reliably increases destabilization (more switching, panic, self-harm urges), pause that technique and step back to basic grounding and seek external support, then review it with a clinician once stabilised.

---

**Remember:** These techniques are not "cures." They are *stabilization tools* that help you move from involuntary, chaotic dissociation to *conscious, intentional* use of your natural dissociative capacity. Your mind is incredibly sophisticated. CTAD Clinic's Dr. Mike Lloyd recommendss working with the system's dissociative talents and not against. Generally if we push too hard then our system will rebound and let us know! Our minds are good at dissociating so use it to your advantage :)
